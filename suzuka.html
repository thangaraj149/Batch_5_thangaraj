Shizuka Minamoto (源 静香, Minamoto Shizuka), nicknamed Shizuka-chan (しずかちゃん) is a smart, kind and pretty girl. She is often represented by the colour pink, and is seen wearing a pink shirt and skirt. The word 'Shizuka (しずか)' means 'Quiet'. She is Nobita's best friend and love-interest. She does not shun Nobita due to his failing grades, lazy disposition or constant failures. In fact, she often tries to encourage him to do better, though she usually fails to convince him. Shizuka likes to bathe several times a day; however, a running gag in the series is that she is sometimes interrupted by a sudden appearance of Nobita (sometimes Doraemon, Gian, or Suneo) usually due to misuse of Doraemon's gadgets like the Anywhere Door (Doko Demo Doa in Japanese). Shizuka's skirt is also frequently seen getting flipped, either by Nobita misusing Doraemon's gadgets, or by the wind. Scenes in which her underwear is seen, or she is seen bathing, have been removed from the dubbed versions, especially in India, Europe, the United States and the United Kingdom. Her true passions are sweet potatoes, which she would rather keep to herself, and the violin, for which her playing is just as horrendous as Gian's singing. She is also known for taking piano lessons reluctantly due to her mother's wishes (as she loves violin more), which is sometimes a reason for declining to hang out with friends (but she plays the piano better than the violin). Shizuka is an animal lover and keeps two pets at home: a dog, who is saved from succumbing to illness by Nobita and Doraemon in one story; and a canary which runs away on multiple occasions and causes Shizuka and Nobita to run around the city chasing it down.

She sometimes fancies handsome idols on TV. Besides Nobita, Shizuka is also close to her classmate and popular student Dekisugi, though they consider each other only as friends.
