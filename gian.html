Takeshi Goda (剛田 武, Gōda Takeshi) usually known by the nickname "Gian" (「ジャイアン」, "Jaian", English: Big G) is a strong and quick-tempered local bully. He frequently steals other children's stuff (especially Nobita's and Suneo's) under the pretext of "borrowing" them, unless the toy is damaged. He is known for his awful singing voice, though he considers himself a great singer. To prove this, Gian sometimes "invites" others to attend his concerts, under the threat of beatings. His singing is so horrible that it causes nausea in listeners; once when Nobita and Doraemon try to mute it in a silent world, Gian's writing of the lyrics on a board have the same nausea-causing effect. Though his voice is terrible, in one of the episodes it was shown that a girl liked his singing. In some films, his singing is enhanced to become an effective weapon (as in 'Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas'). In some episodes when his voice is recorded and he hears the recording, he instantly denies it is his voice and threatens to beat up the person who sang his songs badldy. Gian is also confident in cooking, but just like his singing, his hand-made food can be a nightmare for other people very easily.</p>
